# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Model selection and training (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, R-squared
- Predictions on new data

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Train the model using various algorithms.
4. Evaluate model performance.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Files
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
- `data.csv`: Dataset file (if applicable).

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics, and predictions are generated for house prices based on the trained model.
